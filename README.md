This repository is a project that explores a simulation and mathematical analysis of a simplified model of tree dynamics, based on how trees grow and spread in the video game [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/). 

## Overview of a Stardew Valley Forest

THe screenshot above shows an example of the vegetation on a farm in Stardew Valley. There are several types of trees, grass, and other vegetation. The trees and grass naturally spread to fill available space. Thinking like a biologist, we might wonder: How quickly do the trees fill area? Can the tree populations go extinct? Given several types of trees, will one of the tree species eventually go extinct? While certainly not needed to play the game, answers to these questions give insight into more serious questions in mathematical biology. These questions are the kind we might use a model of real world tree populations to study. In either case, we have to figure out how to calculate the emergent properties of these dynamics.
